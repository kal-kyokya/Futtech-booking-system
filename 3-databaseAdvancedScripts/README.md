# Unleashing Advanced Querying Power

## About the Project

This project is a part of <a href="https://www.futtech.kalkyokya.tech" target="_blank"><b>Futtech</b></a>, where I will implement advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques to work with a simulated Airbnb database. By diving into real-world challenges like optimizing query performance, writing complex SQL scripts, and applying indexing and partitioning, I will gain hands-on experience with database management and performance tuning. This ensures I am equipped to handle large-scale applications where efficiency and scalability are critical.

## Learning Objectives

This project is designed to enhance the skills of any <b>professional developers</b> by focusing on advanced database concepts and practices. By the end of this project, I will:

* <b>Master Advanced SQL</b>: Write complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregations for data retrieval and analysis.
* <b>Optimize Query Performance</b>: Analyze and refactor SQL scripts using performance tools like ```EXPLAIN``` and ```ANALYZE```.
* <b>Implement Indexing and Partitioning</b>: Understand and apply indexing and table partitioning to improve database performance for large datasets.
* <b>Monitor and Refine Performance</b>: Continuously monitor database health and refine schemas and queries for optimal performance.
* <b>Think Like a DBA</b>: Learn to make data-driven decisions about schema design and optimization strategies for high-volume applications.

## Requirements

To successfully complete this project, one must:

* Have a solid understanding of SQL fundamentals, including SELECT, WHERE, and GROUP BY clauses.
* Be familiar with relational database concepts such as primary keys, foreign keys, and normalization.
* Have basic knowledge of performance monitoring tools (```EXPLAIN```, ```ANALYZE```).

## Key Highlights

### 1. Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams

I started by creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, modeling relationships and dependencies between users, bookings, services, and reviews in the Database schema.

### 2. Complex Queries with Joins

Gained expertise in SQL joins with tasks that require combining multiple tables to extract meaningful insights. I explored INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN for various scenarios.

### 3. Power of Subqueries

Developed proficiency with both correlated and non-correlated subqueries. Learned how to nest queries for advanced data analysis, such as calculating average ratings or filtering users based on activity thresholds.

### 4. Aggregations and Window Functions

Unlocked analytical capabilities using SQL aggregation functions like COUNT and SUM. Dived into advanced window functions like ```ROW_NUMBER``` and ```RANK``` to rank and analyze data sets.

### 5. Indexing for Optimization

I identified performance bottlenecks and wrote SQL commands to create indexes for frequently queried columns. They analyze the impact of these changes on query execution times.

### 6. Query Optimization Techniques

Wrote and analyzed complex queries for retrieving detailed information about bookings, properties, users, and payments. Refactored queries to improve execution times by reducing redundancies and leveraging indexing.

### 7. Partitioning Large Tables

Addressed performance challenges with large datasets by implementing table partitioning. Focused on partitioning the Booking table to improve queries on date ranges and compare performance before and after partitioning.

### 8. Performance Monitoring and Schema Refinement

I monitored query performance using ```SHOW PROFILE``` and ```EXPLAIN ANALYZE```, identified bottlenecks, and proposed schema changes. Practical tasks included implementing these adjustments and documenting results.
